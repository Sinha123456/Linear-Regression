# Regression

regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable')
and one or more independent variables(often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').

Linear regression model : The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination)

The Rsquared value is the square of the correlation coefficient.
In general, the closer this value is to 1, the better our model fits the data.

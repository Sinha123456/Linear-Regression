# Regression

regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable')
and one or more independent variables(often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').

Linear regression model : The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination)
